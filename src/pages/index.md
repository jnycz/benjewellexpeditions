        I have been fishing with Ben for 13 years.  Every single trip fishing
        with him is Epic. You won’t find a guide with more energy and
        positivity. Watching my son enjoy and learn from him was truly special.

        I have known and fished with Ben since 2017. He is very knowledgeable
        and fun to fish with. At times he has an uncanny ability to know what
        the fish are doing. He is one of the greats!

        I heartily recommend Ben Jewell as one of the finest guides with whom
        I've had the pleasure of sharing great fly fishing adventures.  I've
        been traveling to the Paradise Valley / Yellowstone National Park area
        for the past 25 years and Ben has guided me and my daughter for the past
        seven years on float trips on the Yellowstone, walk and wades on the
        Gardiner, hikes into the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone, and hikes into
        the second meadow of Slough Creek.  Ben is exceptional at reading water,
        analyzing insect life, and tirelessly putting us on wonderful trout. 
        His enthusiasm for our sport is infectious.  Ben is the best.

        I have been guided by Ben on numerous days, under differing conditions
        for more than 10 years. Above everything but his family, Ben is
        passionate about fly fishing! He loves teaching novices and more
        experienced anglers. He is enthusiastic, and makes the day on the water
        a memorable, fun experience. You can't go wrong utilizing his talents.

        Ben Jewel is the most passionate angler I’ve ever met.  I’ve fished with
        guides all over the world but I always come back to Ben.  His energy is
        contagious and his knowledge of fish and insect patterns are
        unparalleled.  Ben is a hard worker.  I’ve used many guides that know
        what they are doing but they aren’t willing to put in the hard work to
        make that special fish possible, such as Ben does.  Count yourself lucky
        if you can get a day on the water with Ben.  You won’t regret it.

        I have had the pleasure of traveling to Gardiner Montana and fishing
        with Ben Jewell for over a decade.  During that time Ben has never
        failed to go above and beyond to provide his clients with an outstanding
        experience.  Whether it's dredging with Nymphs for big browns or
        floating the Yellowstones in search of cutthroats with dry fly's Ben
        always over delivers and has provided us with an amazing experience.  I
        would highly recommend using Ben Jewell's services if you can, You will
        not regret it.  Ben will help make you a much better fly fisher, and you
        will have a first class professional experience!
