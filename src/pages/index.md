        I have been fishing with Ben for 13 years.  Every single trip fishing
        with him is Epic. You won’t find a guide with more energy and
        positivity. Watching my son enjoy and learn from him was truly special.\

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
