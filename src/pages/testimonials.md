> I heartily recommend Ben Jewell as one of the finest guides with whom I've had the pleasure of sharing great fly fishing adventures.  I've been traveling to the Paradise Valley / Yellowstone National Park area for the past 25 years and Ben has guided me and my daughter for the past seven years on float trips on the Yellowstone, walk and wades on the Gardiner, hikes into the Black Canyon of the Yellowstone, and hikes into the second meadow of Slough Creek.  Ben is exceptional at reading water, analyzing insect life, and tirelessly putting us on wonderful trout.  His enthusiasm for our sport is infectious.  Ben is the best.\

> I have been guided by Ben on numerous days, under differing conditions for more than 10 years. Above everything but his family, Ben is passionate about fly fishing! He loves teaching novices and more experienced anglers. He is enthusiastic, and makes the day on the water a memorable, fun experience. You can't go wrong utilizing his talents.\

> Ben Jewel is the most passionate angler I’ve ever met.  I’ve fished with guides all over the world but I always come back to Ben.  His energy is contagious and his knowledge of fish and insect patterns are unparalleled.  Ben is a hard worker.  I’ve used many guides that know what they are doing but they aren’t willing to put in the hard work to make that special fish possible, such as Ben does.  Count yourself lucky if you can get a day on the water with Ben.  You won’t regret it.\
