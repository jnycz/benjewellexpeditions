Jewell Expeditions is a year-round fishing guide service in the Ruidoso New Mexico area. Ben Jewell has 17 years guiding experience in New Mexico, Montana, and Yellowstone National Park. Offering half and full day trips on public lakes, freestone streams and a private spring creek in the area. 

The value of a guide trip is how many different skills you learn to make you a better angler for future days on the water. Every fly you use will be custom tied for the time of year and specific to that body of water. You will miss fish, lose fish on, and catch fish to learn through your mistakes and triumphs. 1-2 anglers a day go out to give each person the most knowledge and critical criticism possible. 

In fly fishing you get to go to a beautiful place, learn to catch fish, and enjoy your natural surroundings. Fishing teaches you the P's of life, stay positive, be patient, persevere, and you will get a payback. Fish on!
