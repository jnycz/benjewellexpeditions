## Jewell Expeditions: Your Premier Fishing Guide Service in Ruidoso, New Mexico

Discover the ultimate fishing experience with Jewell Expeditions, your year-round fishing guide service in the breathtaking Ruidoso, New Mexico area. With over 17 years of guiding experience in New Mexico, Montana, and Yellowstone National Park, Ben Jewell brings unparalleled expertise to every trip.

We offer half and full day fishing excursions on a variety of pristine waters, including public lakes, freestone streams, and our **exclusive** private spring creek. Each trip is carefully tailored to provide you with an unforgettable angling adventure.

One of the key values of booking a guide trip with us is the opportunity to develop a wide range of skills that will enhance your abilities as an angler for years to come. Throughout the trip, you'll receive personalized instruction and guidance. I take pride in tying custom flies specifically designed for the time of year and the body of water you'll be fishing. This attention to detail ensures that you have the best chance of success.

During your time on the water, you'll undoubtedly encounter various challenges - missed fish, lost opportunities, and triumphant catches. It's through these experiences that you'll learn and grow as an angler. As your guide, I am committed to helping you navigate these situations, offering valuable insights and constructive feedback. With a maximum of only 1-2 anglers per trip, you can expect individualized attention and the opportunity to absorb a wealth of knowledge.

Beyond the technical aspects of fly fishing, our trips provide you with the chance to immerse yourself in the beauty of nature. Picture yourself surrounded by stunning landscapes, casting your line into crystal-clear waters, and experiencing the serenity that comes from being in harmony with the outdoors. Fishing teaches us invaluable life lessons - the importance of staying **p**ositive, practicing **p**atience, and **p**ersevering even when faced with challenges (**The** **P's of life**). It's a journey that rewards both the body and the soul. 

Don't miss out on this extraordinary angling adventure. [Join us](/contact) at Jewell Expeditions and let us guide you to unforgettable fishing experiences. Fish on!
