### What type of guided trips are available?

Half and full day trips on public lakes, freestone streams, and a private spring creek in the area.  Custom trips designed for your level of experience and goals are also available.  Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions.

### When is the best time of year?

Spring and fall offer prime conditions with optimal water temperatures, resulting in outstanding fly fishing experiences.
